Dear Philip,

Below is a recommended strategy for managing the common lesson content while allowing class‐specific customization and maintaining student privacy.

1. Central Repository and Branching Strategy

a. Central Repository (“Common Lessons”):
• Establish a single Git repository (or “monorepo”) for the common lesson material.
• Keep all shared lessons (e.g. data science, observable framework content, teacher notes) on a main branch (often called “main” or “common”).

b. Per-Class Branches:
• At the start of the academic year, create a branch for each class from the common branch (e.g. “year2025-classA”, “year2025-classB”, etc.).
• These branches contain the base common material, then teachers can add class-specific modifications such as localized teacher notes, custom assignments, or activity instructions.

c. Updating Common Material:
• When the common lessons are revised on the main branch, each class branch must update its content by merging or rebasing from the main branch.
• A periodic process—either manual or automated (via CI/CD hooks)—ensures that all class branches remain up to date with any critical updates.

2. Integration with the Tauri Application

a. Lesson Delivery:
• The Tauri app is configured to pull lesson material from the appropriate class branch based on the student’s login.
• At login, the app uses the school’s Git credentials and the branch name corresponding to the class to fetch the latest lessons.

b. Separation of Concerns:
• The repository holds only the lesson content and teacher notes (public to the school).
• Student work, progress, and exam submissions should not be stored in this Git repo. Instead, use a secure local or cloud-based storage solution integrated with the Tauri app to keep student data private.

3. Managing Student Data and Exam Submissions

a. Single Class Repository for Student Access:
• Each class branch serves as the source for the lesson content.
• Students access this branch via the Tauri app, but their personal progress (activity history, exam responses) is maintained in a separate data store (for example, a local encrypted database or a dedicated private repository).

b. Teacher-Only Data:
• Exam submissions and detailed student progress records must be kept confidential and accessible only by teaching staff.
• When an exam is submitted, the Tauri app uploads the response to a secure backend or a teacher-only Git repository (or a private folder within the same repo that is not exposed to students).

4. Workflow Summary
	1.	Common Material Updates:
 – Maintain all shared lesson content in the “main” branch of the central repository.
 – Update content here as improvements are made.
	2.	Class Branch Creation and Customization:
 – At the start of the year, create a branch for each class (e.g., “year2025-classA”).
 – Teachers can add custom notes, schedule-specific modifications, and class activity instructions.
	3.	Periodic Merges/Rebases:
 – Each class branch periodically merges updates from the main branch to incorporate the latest common material while preserving class-specific additions.
	4.	Tauri App Delivery:
 – The Tauri application pulls lessons from the branch that corresponds to the student’s class.
 – The app displays the lessons (markdown, observable notebooks, etc.) and loads any interactive content as needed.
	5.	Student Privacy:
 – Student-specific data (progress, exam submissions) is stored separately from the Git repository.
 – Only aggregated or teacher-approved data is merged into teacher dashboards for review.

This approach minimizes redundancy by keeping one central repository for common content while allowing each class to have its own branch with targeted customizations. It also avoids creating a separate Git repository per student by storing private work in a dedicated secure store.
