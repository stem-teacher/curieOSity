Goal: A simulation to understand the concept and compare its output to real-world experimental data to see how well the simulation matches reality and can be calibrated.  This is for high school Investigating Science, Module 6: Technologies.

Create an interactive AI simulation to demonstrate the effect of temperature on reaction rate.

Specifically, the simulation should:

* **Visually represent:** Reactant and product particles in a reaction environment.
* **Show:**  The energy profile diagram for the reaction (activation energy barrier).
* **Illustrate:** How temperature affects the kinetic energy of particles and the frequency and energy of collisions.
* **Demonstrate:** How increased temperature leads to a higher proportion of particles possessing sufficient activation energy to react.
* **Allow users to:**  Adjust the temperature of the system.
* **Output:**  Visually show changes in:
    * Particle motion (kinetic energy).
    * Collision frequency.
    * Number of successful reactions (those overcoming the activation energy barrier).
    * Reaction rate (qualitatively and, if possible, quantitatively - e.g., a rate constant or time to reach a certain product concentration).

The resulting simulation should be contained in a single markdown page using the observable framework. The observable framework is attached.
