## Original Question
The concentrations of reactants and products as is constant as function of time for the following
system:
\\[ \mathrm{CO(g) + H_2O(g) \rightleftharpoons CO_2(g) + H_2(g)} \\]

Some CO(g) is removed from the system at time T

### **Question B**
Using collision theory, explain the change in the concentration of CO after time T

## Annotated Question
The concentrations of reactants and products [ⅰ](#i) are constant as a function of time [ⅱ](#ii) for the following system:

\\( \mathrm{CO(g) + H_2O(g) \rightleftharpoons CO_2(g) + H_2(g)} \\) [ⅲ](#iii)

Some CO(g) [ⅳ](#iv) is removed from the system at time T.

### **Question B**
{Using}[①](#d1) collision theory [iv](#iv), {explain}[②](#d2) the change in the concentration [ⅴ](#v) of CO [ⅳ](#iv) after time T.

### **Response B**

1.	According to collision theory (CT), at constant temperature (T) and pressure (P), the reaction rate (RR) depends on the frequency of effective collisions between reactant molecules, which is proportional to their concentrations. Specifically:
\\[
RR_{\text{forward}} \propto [\ce{CO}][\ce{H2O}], \quad RR_{\text{reverse}} \propto [\ce{CO2}][\ce{H2}]
\\]

2.	Before time T (t < T), the system is at equilibrium:
\\[RR_{\text{forward}} = RR_{\text{reverse}}\\]

3.	Immediately after time T the concentrations:

3.1. \\( [\ce{CO2}] \\) and \\( [\ce{H2}] \\) remain unchanged, so  \\(RR_{\text{reverse}}\\) stays the same; and

3.2. \\( [\ce{CO}] \\) decreases due to its removal, resulting in fewer effective collisions between CO and H₂O molecules, causing \\(RR_{\text{forward}} \\) to decrease.

4. ∴ \\(RR_{\text{reverse}} > RR_{\text{forward}} \\) leading to a net conversion of products back to reactants. Over time \\( [\ce{CO}] \\) increases until equilibrium is re-established, where:

\\[RR_{\text{forward}} = RR_{\text{reverse}}\\]

**1.** Use gas CT definition. Link collisions to RR.

**3.1** Concentration change \\(RR_{\text{reverse}}\\)

**3.2** Additional link to CT.

**4** Completes \\(\Delta [CO] \\) after time T explaination.

{{% tab "Rationale" %}}
1. **a)** BLUF & direct question trace; **b)** Use the term 'effective collisions' rather than orientation & EA since this a superset and requires less writing; **c)** Link the argument from collisions to RR; and then **d)** Transition from text to mathematics; and then **e)** Define forward and reverse rates of reaction both for explanatory perspectives & as the terms forward and reverse reaction have no actual basis in chemistry.

2. Mathematical define the system is at equilibrium to set context for the remaining argument.

**3** Logical argument to completion.
