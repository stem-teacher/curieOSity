# *Question 25* (5 marks)

The concentration of reactants and products as a function of time for the following system were determined.

${tex`\mathrm{CO}{_{(g)}} + \mathrm{H}_2\mathrm{O}{_{(g)}} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CO}_2{_{(g)}} + \mathrm{H}_2{_{(g)}}`}

At time _T_, some of the ${tex`\mathrm{CO}{_{(g)}}`} was removed from the system.

(a) The concentraction of CO after time _T_ is shown.
Sketch the concentrations after time T for the remaining species.

(b) Using collision theory, explain the change in the concentration of CO after time _T_.
